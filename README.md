# My Portfolio
In this project, I am building the foundation of my online profile to introduce me to potential clients/employers and to show off my software dev/coding skills.  This site has been built from a blank page, integrating Bootstrap 4.5.3 for CSS.  Not Bootstrap CSS modifications have been made; no additional styling (internal or linked) have been applied.  All content is styled using Bootstrap.  

This site includes: a page to provide some introductory information to Steve Babb (me), both professionally and personally, a page with detailed resume information, a portfolio page that will continually be updated with more work as I complete projects, and a page for contacting/connecting with me.

All links that I want to lead somewhere do lead somewhere.  Other links (disabled) will be operational when content connected to the links is ready.

## Project Goal: Build a portfolio page from scratch using Bootstrap
Our only guidance was a series of PNG files showing us wireframes of broad content goals.  We were verbally provided some latitude to go above and beyond and tweak designs, expecting that final product would match PNG files conceptually, but not literally.

Original PNG files/wireframes can be found in the Images folder (each specifying a conceptual display for various screen resolutions). A sample of one of the wireframes we were provided is below.

## Code Validation Testing
I did a code validation using https://validator.w3.org.  Results indicated:

- Some suggestions about placing "articles" closer to H-tag text. I argue that they are in the correct place!  But still learning some of the subtleties of exactly where semantics tags should sit in a block.
- Received an error on some form "input-types".  The types I am using are corrrect; verified both accuracy of the input-types and the inaccuracy of the code validator on multiple sites (e.g stackoverflow).  Several people note the error in the validator rather than the error in the code.
- some indication of open divs.  Tripled checked, they are all associated with a pair/closing div.

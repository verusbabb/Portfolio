# Responsive-Portfolio Overview
In this project, I am building the foundation of my online profile to introduce me to potential clients/employers and to show off my software dev/coding skills.  This site has been built from a blank page, integrating Bootstrap 4.5.3 for CSS.  Not Bootstrap CSS modifications have been made; no additional styling (internal or linked) have been applied.  All content is styled using Bootstrap.  

This site includes: a page to provide some introductory information to Steve Babb (me), both professionally and personally, a page with detailed resume information, a portfolio page that will continually be updated with more work as I complete projects, and a page for contacting/connecting with me.

All links that I want to lead somewhere do lead somewhere.  Other links (disabled) will be operational when content connected to the links is ready.

## Project Goal: Build a portfolio page from scratch using Bootstrap
Our only guidance was a series of PNG files showing us wireframes of broad content goals.  We were verbally provided some latitude to go above and beyond and tweak designs, expecting that final product would match PNG files conceptually, but not literally.

Original PNG files/wireframes can be found in the Images folder (each specifying a conceptual display for various screen resolutions). A sample of one of the wireframes we were provided is below.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards...

- WHEN I view the source code
    - THEN I find semantic HTML elements
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    - THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- WHEN I view the image elements
    - THEN I find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN I view the heading attributes
    - THEN they fall in sequential order
- WHEN I view the title element
    - THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Original Code vs Final/Edited Code
The links below contain the original HTML and CSS files from the working site prior to starting this project.  Compare these to the new .html and .css files in the root directory.

For comparison, here are links to the final edited HTML and CSS code

## Completed Project Link
This site meets all criteria.  **In addition**, I have made the web site header sticky (stays visible when scrolling) and added a "Contact Us" button in the Header.
